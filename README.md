Twittter Lightweight
====================

This project consists in build a lightweight version of Twitter.

For this project i have used Rails, PostgreeSQL and TailwindCSS.

This project is deployed on Heroku...
it's a Cloud Service to deploy web applications, it's really cool, it's is
clean, lightweight and very useful.

I really like it.

That's all.
